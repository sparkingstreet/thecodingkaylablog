                    As I sit here at my computer, I can't help but reflect on my journey in tech. Just when I think I've mastered one challenge, the next one seems to leap right out of nowhere, more daunting than the last.
                    If you've visted my blog before, you might have noticed the new comment box below. Well, here's the kicker---it's not working! (haha!)
                <p>
                    It was functioning beautifully, and I was over the moon! But once I took it live, I hit a snag with getting my database online. College didn't quite prepare me for this;
                    it focused heavily on coding, and my last lesson on servers feels like a distant memory from two years ago. Life has changed a lot since then--
                    I've welcomed a baby and faced significant challenges that have left me feeling a bit scattered.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Sure, college provided solid foundation, but I wish I could access all the knowledge I've forgotten over the years, especially
                    since I haven't been able to use it in my daily life. But here's the silver lining: I have a day off work tomorrow, and I plan to spend a good chunk
                    of it tackling these database dilemmas.
                </p>

                <p>Isn't that what life often feels like? We solve one problem, only for another to emerge. Yet, in the midst of the frustration, there are valuable lessons and skills to be
                    learned. Perhaps the next time I encounter a roadblock, I'll approach it with a more postive attitude, armed with the knowledge that I can persevere and get the job done.
